# BOUNCING OBJECT
1. This is a simple project built based on SFML(Simple and Fast Multimedia Library).
2. Object moves and bounces inside the window.
3. Object type is limit to sf::Rectangle or sf::Circle
4. It would be better to just use inheritance for this class and not a template.
5. Object starting position can be customized(within the window).
